She ended up at Antonelli’s Cheese Shop in Hyde Park, where she met with the manager, Jeanna Moreno. Nicki’s favorite cheese is Queso Fresco, and Jeanna’s favorite cheese is alma, a “kinda funky, garlicky washed-rind cheese” from Vermont.","If this post made you crave your favorite kind of cheese, call Antonelli’s and place an order for curbside pickup, but if you’re not sure what type of cheese you want, that’s okay too! “You can always learn so much more about cheese,” Jeanna says. “We pride ourselves on being accessible. Come see us, and we can definitely help you find what you like.” ",""
