CHEESE! She ended up at Antonelli\u2019s Cheese Shop in Hyde Park, where she met with the manager, Jeanna Moreno. Nicki\u2019s favorite cheese is Queso Fresco, and Jeanna\u2019s favorite cheese is alma, a \u201ckinda funky, garlicky washed-rind cheese\u201d from Vermont. If this post made you crave your favorite kind of cheese, call Antonelli\u2019s and place an order for curbside pickup, but if you\u2019re not sure what type of cheese you want, that\u2019s okay too! \u201cYou can always learn so much more about cheese,\u201d Jeanna says. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being accessible.

Hay Elotes is local favorite that serves antojitos (Mexican street food) including their famous elotes. Once part of Austin\u2019s segregated district, East Austin is now one of the city\u2019s biggest and most diverse neighborhoods, and it\u2019s home to a variety of cultural and historical landmarks. Huston-Tillotson University, a historically black university just around the corner from Hay Elotes, is the oldest university in the city (it was founded 8 years before UT!). A few blocks north, you can check out Victory Grill, one of the last remaining music halls from the Chitlin\u2019 Circuit, where legendary artists like Chuck Berry, James Brown, and Tina Turner once performed to packed crowds. If you\u2019re looking for a fun way to spend a socially-distanced Saturday, you should head down to East Austin and learn about the history behind some of our city\u2019s lesser-known treasure troves-- and be sure to stop by Hay Elotes and grab a tasty treat while you\u2019re there!
